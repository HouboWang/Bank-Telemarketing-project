These are the codes of my final project of STA 221 in 2023 fall. The file combine_proj.ipynb is the code for running models on the data 
removed missing values labeled as ``Unknown'' in the dataset. The other file with_unknown_combine_proj.ipynb is the code for running models on the 
total data, only removed duplicate values.
